The tale blends classic school-year rhythms with an inventive magic system built on runes and resonance, allowing the protagonist to grow from unsure newcomer to a confident wielder of his abilities. The book shines in its character work\u2014firm friendships, mentoring figures, and a believable arc of self-discovery\u2014and in its world-building, where spellcraft feels tangible and the setting is richly imagined. A lurking conspiracy adds tension beyond the classroom, expanding the stakes beyond adolescence. While some tropes feel familiar and the middle act lags a little, the prose remains engaging and the emotional throughline\u2014identity, responsibility, and the cost of power\u2014lands with sincerity. A strong start to a promising series for fans of coming-of-age fantasy with a magic-school backdrop.\"}}",
