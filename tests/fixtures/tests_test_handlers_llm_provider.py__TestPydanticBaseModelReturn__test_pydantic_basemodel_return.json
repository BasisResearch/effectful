The world-building is vivid, with a fresh take on magic grounded in runes and elemental affinities. The character work—friendships, mentor dynamics, and self-doubt—drives a fast-paced school-year plot that balances whimsy with danger. While it leans on familiar tropes of secret origins and rival houses, the emotional honesty and lively prose keep it engaging. Ideal for readers who enjoy classic magical school tales with a modern, character-forward edge.\"}}",
