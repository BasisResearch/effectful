    "- A decorator `Template.define` which creates a prompt template from a callable. A template is an LLM-implemented function whose behavior is specified by a template string. When a template is called, an LLM is invoked to produce the specified behavior.\n",
    "- A decorator `Tool.define` which exposes Python callables as tools that templates can call. Tool signatures and docstrings define the schema passed to the model.\n",
    "- Structured output handling via `Encodable` (used internally by templates and tool calls) to serialize/deserialize Python types.\n",
    "- LLM providers such as `LiteLLMProvider`, and reliability helpers like `RetryLLMHandler` and `ReplayLiteLLMProvider`, which can be composed with `handler(...)` to control execution."

      "In a small, vibrant village nestled between rolling hills and shimmering streams lived the lonely number 1. Unlike other numbers who loved to mingle and form new, exciting figures, 1 felt quite isolated and unimportant. While 2 enjoyed its role in forming even sets, and 3 loved creating perfect triangles, 1 often found itself left alone, yearning for connection.\n",
      "\n",
      "The village of Numeria celebrated numbers every month during the \"Number Day Parade,\" where all digits came together to showcase their contributions to creation. From forming mighty double digits to building equations that solved the world’s mysteries, all numbers were celebrated for their union.\n",
      "\n",
      "As Number Day approached, 1 pondered sadly what it could showcase. Believing it contributed nothing significant, it didn't even plan to participate until it met the wise old number 9 by the river.\n",
      "\n",
      "9 noticed 1's solitary demeanor, \"Why aren’t you preparing for the parade, young 1?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What can I offer?\" sighed 1. \"Alone, I am merely a solitary digit—a beginning perhaps, but never a journey.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "9 chuckled kindly and sat down beside 1. \"Don’t underestimate the power of being the beginning. You may feel insignificant alone, but remember, every number starts with 1. Without you, where would the journey of numbers begin?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "His words ignited a spark of realization within 1. Indeed, every great calculation, every powerful formation started its journey with just one! Rejuvenated, 1 decided to participate, highlighting its unique trait—being the initiator of endless possibilities.\n",
      "\n",
      "During the Number Day Parade, 1 proudly marched, wearing a sash that read \"The Beginning of Infinity.\" To its surprise, the villagers of Numeria cheered the loudest for 1, acknowledging its crucial role in starting every numerical sequence.\n",
      "\n",
      "From that day forward, 1 stood proud and confident. It embraced its uniqueness, understanding that every large number, every infinite calculation, began with it.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "In a quiet, quaint town nestled between lush rolling hills and expansive fields of wildflowers, the number two was revered as something more than just a digit. It was hailed as the number that brought people together. Whenever residents gathered, they spoke of their admiration for the legend of two.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once upon a time, in the heart of this town, there was a young man named Isaac, whose life was ruled by solitude. Isaac found comfort in his books and the steady rhythm of his solitary life. But deep within, he yearned for a connection with another soul.\n",
      "\n",
      "Isaac's life changed on a crisp autumn morning when he chanced upon an old, dusty library hidden near the town's edge, which he had never noticed before. Curiosity piqued, he stepped inside. To his surprise, he met a girl named Elara, who was equally fond of books and had also embraced the quietude of solo adventures.\n",
      "\n",
      "Their encounters grew more frequent, driven by mutual interests in literature and art. Conversations flowed effortlessly, and they discovered that, much like the essence of two, their world was complete when they were together. They found strength in sharing, laughter in understanding, and wisdom in their debates.\n",
      "\n",
      "As time passed, Isaac realized that the notion of two was more than just a story; it was the magic that came alive when two people truly connected. It was not about losing oneself but about finding new parts of yourself in someone else. Through his friendship with Elara, Isaac learned that life was richer when entwined with another, embodying the spirit of two - collaboration, companionship, and connection.\n",
      "\n",
      "The townspeople noticed the change in Isaac. He smiled brighter, walked taller, and shared his stories with renewed vigour. He and Elara became a testament to the power of two, illustrating that the greatest stories weren't those read in isolation but those written together.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Moral:** The essence of two lies in connection and shared experiences, reminding us that relationships, whether with friends or loved ones, enrich our lives and offer us a mirror to discover untapped facets of ourselves.\n",

      "\n",
      "In the quiet town of Numeroville, lived a lively little digit named Three. Unlike the other numbers, Three was always on a quest for adventure, often wandering off to explore the unknown parts of the Numberland.\n",
      "\n",
      "One sunny morning, Three decided it was time to venture out and find the legendary Land of Infinity, a place spoken of in vibrant tales told by the older numbers. With a backpack of curiosity and shoes laced with courage, Three set off on a journey that would change its life.\n",
      "\n",
      "As Three hopped along the Sequential Trail, it stumbled upon a wise old Seven, who was meditating under a multiplication tree.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Where are you off to, young Three?\" Seven asked, opening one calculating eye.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm on my way to the Land of Infinity,\" replied Three with a spark in its eye. \"I want to see if it's true what they say, that numbers never end!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Seven chuckled, \"Ah, the bravest of all quests. But beware, Infinity is a concept bigger than any of us can truly grasp.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Undeterred, Three thanked Seven and continued along the trail. Along the way, it experienced thrilling encounters: helping One and Two who were stuck in a Sum Swamp, racing against fractions who danced precariously on Sum Lines, and even outsmarting the tricky Zero who tried to turn it into nothingness!\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, as twilight approached, Three reached the edge of Known Land where the Fabled Bridge of Infinity supposedly lay. To its amazement, there was indeed a shimmering, endless bridge extending far beyond what Three's eyes could see.\n",
      "\n",
      "Standing there, balancing on the precipice of something magnificent, Three felt a mix of exhilaration and tranquility. It realized that the journey to Infinity wasn’t about reaching the end but rather discovering the infinite possibilities along the way.\n",
      "\n",
      "With a newfound appreciation for the journeys of life, Three turned back, carrying the lesson of Infinity within its heart.\n",
      "\n",
      "And so, Three learned that sometimes, the adventures that matter most aren't those that take us away, but those that bring depth and meaning to our very existence.\n",
      "\n",
      "And the moral of the story? Sometimes, what we seek isn't a destination, but an understanding that the journey itself can bring infinite joy and knowledge.\n",
