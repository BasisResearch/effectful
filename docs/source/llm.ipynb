    "# LLM Interface\n",
    "The `effectful.handlers.llm` module provides a simplified LLM interface that uses algebraic effects for modularity. The module interface consists of:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A decorator `Template.define` which creates a prompt template from a callable. A template is an LLM-implemented function whose behavior is specified by a template string. When a template is called, an LLM is invoked to produce the specified behavior.\n",
    "- A decorator `Tool.define` which exposes Python callables as tools that templates can call. Tool signatures and docstrings define the schema passed to the model.\n",
    "- Structured output handling via `Encodable` (used internally by templates and tool calls) to serialize/deserialize Python types.\n",
    "- LLM providers such as `LiteLLMProvider`, and reliability helpers like `RetryLLMHandler` and `ReplayLiteLLMProvider`, which can be composed with `handler(...)` to control execution."

      "Apartment 1 had seen many a resident pass through its doors, each leaving an indelible mark on its walls. The stories of joy, laughter, and sometimes, tears, filled the rooms with a palpable warmth. But none were as memorable as the story of little Benji, a bright-eyed boy with an insatiable curiosity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Benji moved in with his father, Mr. Ferguson, after the unfortunate passing of his mother. Despite the grief that shadowed their lives, Benji's curiosity never ceased. Each day, after school, he would sit in front of a large, dusty window and peer down at the vibrant street below.\n",
      "\n",
      "One day, as autumn leaves danced across the cityscape, Benji noticed a group of pigeons gathering around a mysterious figure in the park. This figure was dressed in an old, oversized coat, with a wide-brimmed hat casting a shadow over his face.\n",
      "\n",
      "Determined to uncover the secret of the \"Birdman\", as Benji called him, he began sneaking out every afternoon to observe him. Benji soon discovered that Birdman came to the park every day at exactly two post-meridian, feeding the pigeons and sometimes playing a gentle tune on a harmonica.\n",
      "\n",
      "Curiosity got the better of Benji, and one crisp afternoon, he mustered the courage to approach the Birdman. \"Excuse me, sir,\" Benji piped up, \"why do you come here every day and play for the pigeons?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The Birdman paused, then turned to Benji with a smile. \"I was like you once, fascinated by the simplest things. You see, these pigeons remind me of the joy found in little moments. And the music? It's a way to share that joy, even if it's just with these feathered friends.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Benji nodded, understanding a deeper lesson nestled in those words. The Birdman gifted him the harmonica, a melodic reminder that joy could be found and shared anywhere.\n",
      "\n",
      "Benji returned home, his heart light and content, his adventures now filled with music. Apartment 1 at One Tower had become not just a place of residence but a cocoon of discovery and hope. Here, in this little corner of Numeria, Benji learned that no matter how broken the world might seem, a simple melody could bring light into the darkest of places.\n",
      "\n",
      "And so, Apartment Number 1 continued to absorb the tales of its inhabitants, its walls a testament to the resilience of the human spirit, one story at a time. Once upon a time, in the whimsical land of Numerville, there lived a cheerful little number named Two. Unlike other numbers who busied themselves with addition and multiplication all day long, Two had a different perspective. He loved to explore new possibilities in the world of numbers.\n",
      "\n",
      "One sunny morning, as Two hopped along the number line, he stumbled upon a mysterious equation carved into the side of a hill. Curious, he tilted his head to read it. It stated, \"The secret power of Two lies in its ability to create pairs.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Intrigued by this revelation, Two decided to test the theory. He went about pairing with anything he encountered, creating harmonious combinations everywhere he went. First, he joined forces with Three, forming the stable duo of \"Twosday-Tuesday\" which became a day off for numbers to unwind and pair up with their loves. Next, he met Seven, combining to create a portal known as \"Two-Seven-Heaven,\" a lovely meadow where numbers could relax and enjoy games of addition.\n",
      "\n",
      "As Two continued to explore and pair with various numbers, he discovered that his special ability brought balance and joy wherever he roamed. News of Two’s unifying pairs spread across Numerville, and soon even numbers on the farthest corners of the line eagerly sought to pair with him.\n",
      "\n",
      "One day, the Grand Mathematician of Numerville summoned Two to commend his efforts in spreading harmony and showcasing the power contained in unity. \"Two,\" boomed the Grand Mathematician, \"your journey teaches us that every number has its role, and when we unite our differences, we bring extraordinary solutions to the equation of life.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "With a humble smile, Two nodded, understanding that his simple act of pairing had created waves of change in Numerville. And from that day on, in honour of Two, every pairing was celebrated, strengthening the bonds between the numbers of the land.\n",
      "\n",
      "And so, Two lived happily, forever exploring new pairings and enriching the numerical fabric of Numerville with the magic of unity. His tale became a timeless reminder that even the smallest number can create the greatest impact when paired with purpose and kindness. **Title: The Tale of Three**\n",
      "\n",
      "Once upon a time in the bustling town of Numerland, where digits mingled freely, there lived a young number named Three. Unlike his neighbors, who boasted tens and twenties, Three was a modest number, yet he wore his simplicity with pride.\n",
      "\n",
      "Three spent most of his days helping Multiplication and Division. Despite his humble size, he was a favorite for his ability to transform into six or nine effortlessly. Whether playing tag with Addition or solving problems with Subtraction, Three was always full of energy.\n",
      "\n",
      "One day, a grand contest was announced by Count, the wise old mathematician. It was a test of capability, where numbers were tasked with forming equations that resulted in the grand number hundred. Eager to participate, Three paired up with his closest friends, Thirty and Sixty-Seven.\n",
      "\n",
      "The trio worked tirelessly, brainstorming day and night. Their journey to create the perfect equation was not easy. Many combinations failed them, when impatience led to miscalculations, or exhaustion dulled their thinking. But they pressed on, each learning from their missteps.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the day of the competition, the trio stepped up with confidence. They showcased their equation: Thirty plus Sixty-Seven plus Three. Their daring combination was simple yet precise, achieving exactly one hundred. The other numbers watched in awe as the practitioner judges nodded in approval.\n",
      "\n",
      "Three's crew won that day, proving that even the smallest numbers could achieve greatness with teamwork and determination. They were celebrated throughout Numerland as heroes, teaching everyone the valuable lesson that no number is too small to make a significant impact.\n",
      "\n",
      "From that day forward, Three was never underestimated again. Instead, he became an inspiration, always reminding others that with big dreams and the right comrades, anything is possible. Once upon a time, in the small village of Numerica, lived a unique character known as Four. Four wasn't just any number; he was proud to be an important figure in mathematics, holding a curious position between three and five.\n",
      "\n",
      "One day, the numbers in the village decided to organize a grand festival to celebrate the importance of numbers in everyday life. Each number was tasked with showcasing their unique attributes and contributions to the world.\n",
      "\n",
      "As the festival began, One proudly displayed the concept of singularity and leadership. Two showcased partnerships and teamwork. Three brought to life the idea of balance and stability, often seen in tripods and tricycles. Meanwhile, Five displayed living in harmony with nature, showing off the perfect number of fingers on a hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "When it was Four’s turn, he decided to illustrate the beauty of symmetry and balance. He reminded everyone of the four seasons that bring change and renewal, the four cardinal directions guiding travelers on their journeys, and the four limbs that enable many creatures to move with grace.\n",
      "\n",
      "The others nodded in agreement, but one doubt lingered: Four had a challenge to distinguish himself further. So, he told a story of his essential role in harmony and structure — such as providing the foundation for squares and rectangles, vital in architecture and art.\n",
      "\n",
      "As Four continued, the village listened intently and the other numbers began clapping. Four not only demonstrated his versatility but also showed that even in the world of numbers, unity and function are most vital when each part respects the whole.\n",
      "\n",
      "As the festival concluded, the numbers realized how entangled their functions were. Each number played an integral role in building the tapestry of reality. Four felt proud knowing he had highlighted the significance of his position and earned the respect of all his numerical peers.\n",
      "\n",
      "The celebration deepened friendships amongst all numbers and ended with a beautiful display of fireworks forming a giant Four in the sky, reminding everyone of his place in the mathematical universe.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus, in Numerica, the festival ended with a valuable lesson: every number, no matter how small or large, holds importance and together, they create harmony in the world. And so, Four felt fulfilled, contributing to the unity of the lively village of Numerica.\n",
