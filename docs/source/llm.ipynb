    "# LLM Interface\n",
    "The `effectful.handlers.llm` module provides a simplified LLM interface that uses algebraic effects for modularity. The module interface consists of:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A decorator `Template.define` which creates a prompt template from a callable. A template is an LLM-implemented function whose behavior is specified by a template string. When a template is called, an LLM is invoked to produce the specified behavior.\n",
    "- A decorator `Tool.define` which exposes Python callables as tools that templates can call. Tool signatures and docstrings define the schema passed to the model.\n",
    "- Structured output handling via `Encodable` (used internally by templates and tool calls) to serialize/deserialize Python types.\n",
    "- LLM providers such as `LiteLLMProvider`, and reliability helpers like `RetryLLMHandler` and `ReplayLiteLLMProvider`, which can be composed with `handler(...)` to control execution."

      "In a land far beyond imagination, where numbers were not just symbols but beings with feelings and desires, there was a little number known as One. Though often underestimated, One had a dream larger than any universe: to find its true purpose.\n",
      "\n",
      "One was simple, yet unique. It started each day by enjoying the sunrise, counting the seconds in silent appreciation of the continuum of time. Yet, in the grand tapestry of numbers, One felt ordinary and unnoticed, especially among the grandiosity of larger numbers like Millions and Billions, which often boasted about their size and importance.\n",
      "\n",
      "One day, O came across Zero, a soft-spoken and kind companion, often seen lingering in the shadows of others. \"Why do you look so glum, One?\" asked Zero as they both watched the twinkling stars above.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I feel small in a world full of giants. What significance do I hold when everyone seems to multiply and magnify everything far beyond my own capacity?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Zero smiled softly. \"You must explore, dear One. For you might be small, but with the right touch, you can change everything. You are the beginning of dreams, the spark that starts a continuum.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Taking this advice to heart, One embarked on a journey to discover its true power and potential. As it wandered through the Land of Mathematics, it met Addition, the kind-hearted magician, who taught One how it could transform nothing into something, just by joining in a dance.\n",
      "\n",
      "With Multiplication, One learned coordination and rhythm, expanding its influence exponentially with a simple step forward. There were days spent in the Company of Fractions, shrinking itself to explore the depth of intricacy plus seeing life from a new perspective.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, it found itself near the great figure of Unity, where all numbers whether large or small, participated in harmony. Here, One discovered its greatest potential—to bring completeness. When used wisely, One could complete a perfect circle or spell disaster if miscalculated.\n",
      "\n",
      "In its quest, One realized its strength was simplicity itself. As small as it was, it was the foundation upon which countless worlds depended. Without One, there was nothing to start; no Number Line, no Life Progression.\n",
      "\n",
      "And so, One returned to its place in the universe, no longer ordinary but extraordinary in its ability to bring beginnings.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus, the moral of the story: No matter how small or insignificant you feel, remember that you have the power to change everything. You are the first step in your journey and those of others. Embrace your role and start with conviction, for you are One. \n",

      "And sometimes, that's all you need to be remarkable.\n",

      "Once upon a time in the quaint village of Digiton, nestled in the Valley of Numerals, lived the number 2. In this village, each number had their unique talents and ways to contribute to the community. Number 2 was known for its ability to find wonderful pairings and create harmony.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a bright, sunny morning when 2 decided it was time to plan the grand Numerals Gala, an event celebrated by all numbers from 1 to 9. This year's theme was \"Unity in Pairs,\" and 2 took the responsibility seriously.\n",
      "\n",
      "With a checklist in hand, 2 began to organize the event. First, 2 visited its oldest friend, the number 1. \"Would you be one half of a winning pair, dear friend?\" 2 asked. \"Of course,\" replied 1, \"together we make the perfect pair of Unity, everyone knows!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, 2 approached the number 3. Though sometimes perceived as a little off-kilter, 3 was eager to join and suggested pairing with 4 to symbolize growth and progression: 3 plus 4 always added up to 7—a lucky number for all.\n",
      "\n",
      "Eager to ensure everyone was included, 2 made a special stop at number 5's cheerful blue cottage. \"5, would you create a bridge with me?\" 2 proposed. \"Together we form \"7\", the lucky charm—how can I resist?\" giggled 5.\n",
      "\n",
      "Day by day, the excitement in Digiton grew. Numbers periodically gathered in the square to rehearse their speeches and musical acts. Finally, the day of the Gala arrived, and pairs paraded on stage, highlighting unity through their performances. The pairing of 6 and 7 showcased a dance of luck and prosperity, while 8 and 9 painted visions of a dreamy future.\n",
      "\n",
      "As everyone settled down for the final speech, number 2 took the stage, its heart full of joy. \"Dear friends,\" 2 began, \"thank you for showing us the beauty of partnership. Alone, each of us is a number, but together, we build the world. Let us remember that two is a bond that shows love, loyalty, and peace.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "With a warm round of applause, the Gala concluded, but in their hearts, every number knew that it was 2's thoughtful pairing that showed them the profound harmony within.\n",
      "\n",
      "And so, 2's legacy in Digiton was etched as a gentle, powerful reminder that the most meaningful journeys are those taken with another by your side. Such was the wisdom of number 2.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once upon a time, nestled in the quiet and serene landscape of Numerland, there was a unique and charismatic number named \"Three.\" Unlike the other numbers, Three was proudly quirky and adventurous. Sporting three shining points, he dazzled with a triangular shape that made him quite distinctive among his peers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Three lived in the bustling community of Tallytown, a place where numbers came together to form equations, solve problems, and have numerical debates. But Three often felt that Tallytown was too caught up in linear thinking. He liked to think outside the box—or pyramid, in his case.\n",
      "\n",
      "One sunny day, Three decided to embark on an adventure across the wide fields of positivity. His first stop was Addition Avenue, a lively street where numbers piled atop each other, eagerly building bridges to larger sums. While there, Three met other numbers like Six and Nine, who greeted him warmly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why travel, Three?” asked Six.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm seeking something more,\" Three replied. \"I feel like there's a whole world of meritorious multiplicities and radiant reciprocals waiting for me!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "With a friendly nod, Three continued on his journey. He navigated through Subtraction Square, where he learned to appreciate simplicity. As he passed through, Two’s counsel resonated: “Sometimes less is more, Three.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Eventually, Three found himself at the multipliers' meadow, a wide expanse where numbers did cartwheels, creating exponential wonders. It was here he met Zero, who diffidently warned, \"Multiply with me, and I'll vanish you into nothingness!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Three chuckled at the paradox and moved on. He rolled over to Division Dale, where he admired the symmetry of parts and ratios. Three realized he was not just a number but a part of something truly wondrous.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, gazing at the starry skyscape of Infinity Lane, Three discovered his true potential—he was a constant, reliable factor that held significance beyond simple numerical value. Each point of his triangular form seemed to twinkle with this newfound wisdom.\n",
      "\n",
      "As he made his way back home to Tallytown, Three felt renewed, armed with appreciation for his uniqueness and the harmony between all numbers. He returned not just as Three, but as the representation of balance, creativity, and the beautiful geometric world from which he drew his strength.\n",
      "\n",
      "And so, in the land of Numerland, Three lived happily, not just a simple integer, but a remarkable journey in and of itself—a point of convergence in a universe of endless possibilities.\n",
      "\n",
      "**The Tale of Four Friends**\n",
      "\n",
      "Once upon a time, in the cozy town of Little Numbers, there dwelt a modest fellow known simply as \"4.\" Though he appeared ordinary, 4 was actually quite special. He had three devoted friends: 1, 2, and 3. Together, they formed a dynamic quartet of remarkable adventures.\n",
      "\n",
      "One bright spring morning, they embarked on a journey to solve the mystery of the Lost Sequence. It was said that the sequence held the secret to solving any mathematical problem, and possessing it would mean endless possibilities.\n",
      "\n",
      "4, ever confident in his stability, led the group with enthusiasm. \"We can decipher any riddle with our unity,\" he declared, his square-shaped stature conveying authority.\n",
      "\n",
      "Their first challenge arrived at the Great Divide Canyon, a vast gap that seemed insurmountable. \"Fear not!\" said 2, offering help with her talent for pairing. She balanced 1 on her left and 3 on her right. Effortlessly, they formed a bridge sturdy enough for 4 to cross, leading them all safely to the other side.\n",
      "\n",
      "The team soon reached the Valley of Equations, where intricate puzzles befuddled passersby. With 4's knack for balance and proportion, they made short work of the conundrums. 1's simplicity, combined with 3's creative approach, solved complex equations, while 2's knack for harmonizing detected patterns invisible to others.\n",
      "\n",
      "As they journeyed deeper, they encountered the enigma known as the Paradox Terrain. Here, problems that seemed unsolvable loomed ominously. \"Let us remember,\" 4 reminded them, \"that solutions are often nearer than they appear.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "With a fresh perspective, 3 noticed a pattern: each unsolvable problem required going back to basic principles. By retracing steps, simplifying assumptions, and adding unique insights, they cracked the paradox.\n",
      "\n",
      "At last, the quartet arrived at the Chamber of the Lost Sequence, where wisdom awaited them. The mystical sequence unveiled itself, revealing the elegance of mathematical harmony, in which each number played a crucial role.\n",
      "\n",
      "Embracing the sequence, the friends returned to Little Numbers, wiser and more united than ever. Thus, in the camaraderie of 4 and his friends, the town learned a timeless lesson: the greatest strength comes not from singular achievement, but from the harmony of collective unity.\n",
      "\n",
      "And so, they lived happily and mathematically ever after.\n",
