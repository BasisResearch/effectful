    "# LLM Interface\n",
    "The `effectful.handlers.llm` module provides a simplified LLM interface that uses algebraic effects for modularity. The module interface consists of:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A decorator `Template.define` which creates a prompt template from a callable. A template is an LLM-implemented function whose behavior is specified by a template string. When a template is called, an LLM is invoked to produce the specified behavior.\n",
    "- A decorator `Tool.define` which exposes Python callables as tools that templates can call. Tool signatures and docstrings define the schema passed to the model.\n",
    "- Structured output handling via `Encodable` (used internally by templates and tool calls) to serialize/deserialize Python types.\n",
    "- LLM providers such as `LiteLLMProvider`, and reliability helpers like `RetryLLMHandler` and `ReplayLiteLLMProvider`, which can be composed with `handler(...)` to control execution."

      "As soon as he entered, he was faced with the most peculiar sight—an old automatic vacuum cleaner. To Whiskers, this was no ordinary device. He saw it as a mysterious, growling beast that needed to be conquered. With a mighty pounce, he landed squarely on top of it. Unfortunately for Whiskers, he had activated the vacuum, sending it whirring around the garage with him clinging for dear life.\n",
      "\n",
      "The “wild ride” that ensued was a scene to behold. The vacuum zoomed forward, backward, and in crazy circles, causing Mr. Johnson’s carefully stacked boxes to tumble down like dominoes. Paint cans rattled, and a garden gnome was knocked over, all while Whiskers' fur stood on end with a mixture of excitement and terror.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hearing the commotion, Mrs. Johnson rushed to the garage, expecting to find some sort of intruder. Instead, she found Whiskers riding the chaos-inducing vacuum. With laughter bubbling up, she quickly turned off the machine, releasing a very dizzy kitty.\n",
      "\n",
      "Whiskers stumbled off, shook his furry head, and gave Mrs. Johnson a look that seemed to say, \"I totally meant to do that.\" She couldn't help but laugh and gave Whiskers a good scratch behind the ears as a reward for his bravery.\n",
      "\n",
      "After this hair-raising adventure, Whiskers promised himself to stay out of the Johnsons' garage, at least for a day or two. Instead, he decided to take a nap in a sunbeam, where the only danger was a dream about chasing more imaginary beasts.\n",
      "\n",
      "And so, in the little town, Whiskers cemented his reputation as the cat who tamed the wild, untamable vacuum, and the townsfolk couldn't wait to see what this curious feline would do next.\n"

      "The villagers worshipped the number \"1\" with great reverence, attributing it to unity, beginnings, and singularity. They celebrated a special festival each year called \"Uno Fest\" to honor this special number. At the center of the festival was a magical ceremony where they would light a single candle, representing the oneness of life.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the eve of the current year's Uno Fest, a young boy named Eli was curious to discover the true power of the number \"1.\" Eli believed that if he could understand its power, he could bring joy and prosperity to everyone in the village. He wandered into the forest, known for its mystical aura, hoping to find answers.\n",
      "\n",
      "As he ventured deeper into the woods, Eli stumbled upon an ancient stone tablet inscribed with the symbol \"1.\" As he touched it, a wise old spirit appeared. \"Young Eli,\" the spirit spoke gently, \"what do you seek?\" Eli replied, \"I want to understand the true power of '1.'\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The spirit smiled and began to explain, \"The power of '1' lies not in its numerical value, but in its meaning. It is the essence of unity and the beginning of everything. It symbolizes the potential in new beginnings and the importance of staying true to oneself. Every great journey begins with one single step.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Inspired by the spirit's words, Eli returned to the village filled with newfound wisdom. At the Uno Fest, he shared his experience with the villagers, preaching the importance of unity and the power within each of them to make a positive difference. The festival of celebration turned into a day of reflection and unity, solidifying the village's bond.\n",
      "\n",
      "And so, the legend of the number \"1\" continued, carrying forward the eternal truth that every great achievement starts with a single, powerful step. Eli's journey reminded everyone in Numeria that they, too, had the power to begin anew, united in their strength and purpose. The moral of the story was clear: In unity, there is strength, and every great journey begins with one small step.\n",
      "As the first rays of the sun began to peek over the horizon, an old clockmaker named Elias woke up in the small village of Havenwood. Elias had lived in the village all his life, surrounded by ticking clocks and the gentle hum of their mechanisms. Each clock in his shop was a testament to his craftsmanship and passion.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elias had a special fondness for the number 2, considering it his lucky number. All his life, he noticed that significant events happened in pairs: two opportunities to become a clockmaker, two chances to meet the love of his life, and eventually two beautiful children. He often mused, \"Things come in pairs for a reason.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "One fine morning, as Elias was dusting and winding the clocks in his shop, he stumbled upon an old, dusty wooden box. The box wasn't remarkable in appearance, but when Elias opened it, he found two identical pocket watches, each intricately designed with silver filigree and an unmistakable engraving of a pair of doves. How these watches ended up in the shop was a mystery, but Elias decided to restore them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Days turned into weeks, and Elias worked meticulously on the pocket watches. He polished every surface, repaired the delicate gears, and reattached the hands. Upon completion, he marveled at their beauty and symmetry—two perfect creations reflecting his life's philosophy.\n",
      "\n",
      "As fate would have it, a traveler visited Havenwood and was drawn to Elias’s shop. The traveler, a young woman named Amelia, was captivated by the twins’ watches. She explained that she was on a journey to find something significant, something that spoke to her heart.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elias, sensing the unique connection between the watches and this traveler, shared their story. He spoke of his life of dualities and how everything always seemed to come in pairs, especially the most meaningful elements. Touched by his tale, Amelia purchased both watches, declaring one would be for her and the other for her twin sister, whom she had not seen in years.\n",
      "\n",
      "As Amelia left the shop, Elias felt a surge of contentment. He realized that his belief in the power of two was not just a whimsical notion, but a living testament to the interconnectedness of lives and the potential of renewed connections.\n",
      "\n",
      "Amelia's story and the paired watches’ journey reminded Elias of the simple truth: that sometimes, things are meant to be found—not alone, but together. Whether it was pairs of events or connections, the number 2 would always hold a special place in the heart of a humble clockmaker who saw symmetry and significance in every ticking second.\n",
